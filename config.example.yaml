# Configuration file for Dagster Finance Pipeline
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize with your transaction exclusions
# DO NOT commit config.yaml to git if it contains sensitive information
#
# Note: Account mappings are now managed via dbt seed files:
#   - dbt/seeds/seed_account_mapping_simplefin.csv
#   - dbt/seeds/seed_account_mapping_historic.csv

# Transaction Description Exclusions
# Transactions matching these patterns will be excluded from processing
# These are typically credit card payments, transfers, or other non-transactional items
transaction_exclusions:
  # Description patterns to exclude (case-insensitive)
  # Uses SQL ILIKE pattern matching (supports % wildcards)
  description_patterns:
    - "%Credit Card Payment%"
    - "%AUTOPAY PAYMENT%"
    - "%Transfer%"
    # Add more patterns as needed

# Model Configuration
# Settings for the transaction classifier model
model:
  # Confidence threshold for predictions (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Predictions below this threshold will be marked as 'UNCERTAIN'
  # Lower values = more predictions but potentially lower precision
  # Higher values = fewer predictions but higher precision
  confidence_threshold: 0.40
