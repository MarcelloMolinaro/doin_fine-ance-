# TODOs

- Delete committed artifacts/logs and tighten `.gitignore`
- Add a Databricks source integration and test end-to-end
- Build Python models to pull data from Plaid
- Enable dbt <> dagster connection so I don't need to define each source? I haven't built any of this out yet

- Create a config files that manages all secrets, passwords, etc.
- Move profiles OUT of dbt or stop tracking it, or both
